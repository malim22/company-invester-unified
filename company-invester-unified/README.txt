# Bridge Between Investor and Business People

## How to Run the Project:

1. Open this folder in **VS Code**
2. Right-click on `index.html` â†’ Click **'Open with Live Server'**
   (You must have the "Live Server" extension installed)

3. Register a user, and the data will be saved to **Madhuriâ€™s Firebase Firestore**

âœ… Firebase is already connected â€“ no extra setup needed.

If you face any CORS error, DO NOT open `index.html` directly from file explorer. Use Live Server.
